          Okay folks here it is. The price tag (yuck!). There's no saving of all your
          great work in the non-registered version, so you girls and guys mmmmmmmight
          as well get the chance to have it all.<br>
          So what's going to be. Stefan put all this work into this nice program
          and he's working at it all the time. It really is up to him then you see.
          Nono. No "why don't ya mail yours to me and I'll send you a sixpack of ..."
          or something like that , 'cause your letter'll get trashed (or deleted)
          faster than you can say "burned at the stake".<br>
          Stefan has every right to put a price tag onto such a big and complex piece
          of software. Hey it's not Imagine so there's no "for a $1000 it CAN be yours!!".
          Play around with it. See what you like, what you don't. Write that down and
          e-mail it to Stefan (or me,I'll relay everything to him). After you've had a
          swell time, think of what it would be like to have it all on disk. All your
          hard work not gone when you exit <b>SoundFX</b> or reach down to hit that switch.
          Think about it ... you can save 16-bit stuff. Convert just about anything into
          anything, perform dozens of mutilating operations on those innocent samples,
          twist 'em to your hearts desire. Imagine your friends awe at your samples
          quality. This is the best in effect software and it won't cost ya $200.<br>
          If Stefan doesn't put a price tag in here I guess you should write an e-mail to
          him and ask. Tell him what you don't like about the prog, while you're at it.
          And say what you like as well. The guy deserves a patt on the back for it.<br>
          So , I'll leave you in the capable hands of Stefan now. He'll give you his
          address and phone number and way you can send the truck of cash to his place.

          Thanks AiRoN - I think everybody knows now, that it's a good idea to register
          and here comes the price.

					Of course you could pay more :-).<br>

					With this keyfile all functions in the program will be available. The keyfile
