check software for all file related errors
	make sure there is alwas a message shown
	improve these to always include the filename
	split "cannot open file <XYZ>" into
		"cannot open file <XYZ> for reading"
		"cannot open file <XYZ> for writing"
can we collect message?
	subtask either deposit messages as reasons for parent tasks failures
	e.g. when saving a file
		"Saving the file failed, because
			the file <XYZ> could not be opened for writing, because
			the disk is write-protected"
