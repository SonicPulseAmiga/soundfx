> The first band goes up to 648 hz and the last to 44100 hz, that makes no sense.
A:
The current equalizer is based on the fft. This algorithm splits the
frequency-space into fixed ranges.
The overall area covered is 0 Hz to samplingfreq/2.
For SoundFX 4.1 I plan to include a full-parametric equalizer (4 bands +
low/High shelf)

A:
I belive you can. At first I recommend to use the 'Filter-StateVariable' as this
is fast and powerful.
A filter basicaly has three parameters :
  1. model : lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandstop, ... - you would choose
  lowpass in your case
  2. the cut-off frequency (this is the frequency where the amplitude has
  already dropped by 3db)
  3. the resonance (this attenuates frequencies around the cut-off)
-
SoundFX keeps most Parameters modulatable and not static as most other apps to.
Both Cut-Off and Resonancy are modulatable. Such parameter can be controlled
innearly every thinkable way. Therefor you have those blend-shapes (the
cycle-button). You basically enter a start and end value and the shape
alternates between them. There is an extensive chapter in the guide (the chapter
about operators).

I guess a good way to start here is to use StateVariable as an effect (as 
Stefan suggested) and let the cutoff be modulated by the signal's 
amplitude. Since I haven't used SFX for some time now, I couldn't tell you 
exactly how this is achieved, but you have to set the modulation to 
"USER"-something (again, I can't tell you the exact labelling.) then you 
can choose between frequency and amplitude modulation. The only thing you 
have to do is to set the two values for cutoff to reasonable values 
(experimentation rules!!!) and set the resonance to a fairly high value. 
Voila! Instant jumpy filters attack.

A:
Not really. That is the unfortunate limitation of the FFT. If you are
interested in lower frequencies, you can zoom. Just low-pass-filter the
signal and resample it (you can use the builtin aliasing-filter of the
resample-operator). Then start analyse-2d.
What I could do, is to try to build an spectrum-analyser on the base of
bandpass-filters. This analyser could then arbitrary zoom-into the
signal.

A:
It can't be perfectly flat. Depending on the quality of the
random-number generator the noise is more or less 'white'.

A:
I assume, that you have recored in 16bit with 44100/48000 Hz.
The easierst is to use a low-pass filter. Because you want good cancelation,
I suggest to use Filter-FIRLowPass (and not the state-variable-filter).
Start the filter and enter 13000 Hz for the cut-off, sert modulation to none,
as you don't want to create artistic sounds. Number should be something like 64.

Use the Analyse-Spects-2D to verify thet high frequencies have been canceld out.
You can even apply the filter several time to increase steepness and dampening.
