A:
All can be done. SoundFX's RAW loader has a nice feature - a configurable
'autodectection' for raw-files.
That means you can associate a file extension or a pattern (some id) in the file
with a set of options.
To load cdda-file automaticaly in the right way, you would load the cdda-preset
and edit it's setting to your desire.
e.g.
    Format=16 bit signed
    Endian=Intel
    Channels=stereo interleaved
and associate this with the ending '.cdda'.
Then you enable the autodetection and save this settings as default.cfg.
Everytime you load a file via 'Universal'-loader or 'RAW'-loader, the format
gets detected properly and converted as said above.

A:
Just choose your device and unit and save this as 'default.cfg'.

A:
* start raw-loader GUI
* load cdda.cfg
* change setting to you needs (16bit signed, stereo interleaved, intel/motorolla
  order)
* save this as cdda.cfg again
* activate 'autodetect' (I don't remember the exact name)
* if there is no entry for cdda yet, create one
  * press add
  * select cdda.cfg
  * and enter '.cdda'
   this means whenever a file is called '.cdda' the use the setting from the
   cdda.cfg
* save this now as 'default.cfg'
