Q:

that all 3 could change the pithc of a sound without altering it's lenght?
A: 
Thats an easy one. Detune and Resample are quite similiar. They both
just output incomming sample slower or faster. - 
-
The difference is resample is doing this with a constant rate e.g. output 3
values for each two incomming ones, while Detune can do this with a varying
factor.
Resample offers a few gimmicks to cure diseases which can be caused by doing this
(aliasing). 
-
[on how aliasing would develop:]
just a example : think of a wave containing 
+-+-+-+- 
now you down sample it by factor two and you would get
+++ 
means the high frequencey has canceled itself or even became a small 
dc-offset. it	gets worser if you downsample by fractional factors.e.g. 1.5
+--
There is a very easy way to see and hear the effect. Use Synthesize-add and
generate a sine-sweep from 1000 Hz to e.g. 10000 Hz but choose a sampling 
rate of e.g. 44100. the result should be something like puuuuuiiiiiiieeeee ;-)
But it will be something like puuuuiiiiieeeeeiiieeeeuuueeeeiii. You use 
Analyse-Spect-2D to visualize it.
-
You would use Resample if you have a sample recorded e.g. at 22050 Hz and you
want to use it in a software which requires samples recorded at 44100. 
-
Resample changes the sample so that it sounds the same when played back at 44100
instead of 22500. 
Resample steps through the sample at a constant speed (read factor e.g. something
like 3.0 or even fractonal like 2.75). It can interpolate if desired and when
downsampling (resulting samplingrate is lower and there are less values) it can
be asked to low-pass filter the signal first.
-
In contrast, with Detune you can do things like simulation the effect of a
power-outage of a vinyl-player. Detune also steps through the sample, but with
dynamic speed aka a dynamic factor. It leaves the samplingrate untouched.
-
Both operators have one thing in comon - they change the length of the sample
along with the pitch. 
-
Now to Pitchshift. Its speciallity is that it changes the pitch without changing
the length, by using a lot of magic. 
There is another fx which will appear in SFX sooner or later (I wish sooner). Its
called Timestretch and it makes a sample longer or shorter whitout changing the
pitch. Basically this is a pitchshift followed by a resample (thus can be
simulated in sfx alreday).
