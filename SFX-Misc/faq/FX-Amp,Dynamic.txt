A:
The first is easy. Use AmplifySplit. there you can aplify upper and lower parts
individually. Thus you can amplify the upper by '1.0' and the lower by '-1.0'
and therfore just inverting the lower part. Then apply a lowpass with a cutoff
at about '250 Hz'. Another good idea is to mix the signal with a delayed copy of
itself (choose a delay of e.g. 25 ms in the Mix-operator).
I've not tried the values, so please experiment and tell us then.

A:
Ofcourse you can use slide to slide it 50 % down and then Amplify to scale it to
200 %. If you use it in SoundFX for modulation, just use
the modulation mode 'abs'.
Even easier is to use soundfx's ability to create those envelopes on-the-fly.
You know that soundfx is able to do that ? Choose blend-shape=User, then
activate the setting and choose the source sample (where to grab that envelope
from) and modulation type AmpEnv (AmplitudeEnvelope).

Q:

A:
In former SoundFX version this was called 'CompressorExpander'. I renamed it,
because it works different. You give the operator a factor for the loudest value
(full amplitude) and a factor for the quietest (zero). Inbetween the operator
interpolates linear.

Q:

A:
SoundFX will never reject a parameter because it looks unfamilliar. that's why
my operators can produce some many different results. When you enter a negative
value for the quiet, then it will inverse quiet sounds and the interpolation
will range from that negative value to the (probably) positive value for loud.

Thats easy. You can use the 'Amplify'-Operator for that. Just press
MaxVol there and it calculates the optimal amplification. When you have
a batch of file to maximize, then use the Batchprocessor :
  1. Loader : Universal
  2. Operator Amplify, Preset MaxVol
  3. Saver : e.g. IFF-AIFC
Then you just select source and destination directories and hit start.

If all tracks are amplified to full extent, its a bit more difficult. It
would mean to use AnalyseData for each track and to write down the
'RMS-Volume'. Then you could make the louder tracks quieter (with
amplify) to reduce their energy (RMS-Volume) or use the dynamic operator
to compress the silent tracks (e.g. loud values=0.9, quiet values 1.0)
and then amplify (maxvol) them to make them louder.
