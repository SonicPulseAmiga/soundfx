A:
This is an easy one. Try it, even though it sounds odd. Use the
Delay-FX. There should be a preset 'DeHummer_50Hz'.
What it does is : it resonates on 50 Hz and suppresses the resonation.
Works just wonderful. If there is a remaining hum, just apply it twice
(or even more often, which is selden required though) .

I don't believe it is possible to get good results by trying to remove
crackles from LP automatically. There are many peak wave forms which are
part of the music but have very similar characteristics to clicks.
-
In particular, filters acting in the frequency domain are NOT the way to
go. A click is an impulse signal and therefore contains all frequencies.
Removing the high frequencies just spreads it out.
-
You need software which looks for particular shapes in the wave form
which are typical of clicks. I don't know of any on the Amiga. I made a
test routine a couple of years ago as an experiment, but I am not a C or
assembly programmer, so I did it in ARexx. This of course is much too
slow for anything other than tests on a few seconds of audio.
-
The best program I've found is Wave Repair for the PC. This is a
shareware program. It finds the clicks (of various sizes and shapes),
and you can then remove them either singly (safest) or automatically (if
you don't mind losing some music). It is well thought out.
-
There is no easy way.

A:
Generally I recomment the following approach. After recording apply :
1. Middle -> removes the dynamic offset, important for crack/noise-detection
2. DeNoise-FIR
3. DeCrackle
-
I have a new Decrackle-Algorithm in mind. Hopefully it will made it into
next version.

A: Quoted by Don Cox from http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~abcomp/lp-cdr.htm
-
1. Get a noise fingerprint from the WAV file to be 
decrackled. In other words, find a section that contains 
only noise and light crackle, but no
music. 
-
2. Use the noise fingerprint to do a noise reduction 
over the whole file, but keeping just the noise (rather 
than the music minus the noise). You
need to do a fairly brutal noise reduction (eg. 100% in 
CoolEdit). What you end up with is the noise, the light 
crackle, and a bit of the music. 
-
3. Save the noise that's just been isolated, either in a file 
or a clipboard. 
-
4. Run a declick operation over the noise. Be fairly 
aggressive, so as to find all the crackle. You now 
have the noise minus the crackle. 
-
5. Mix-paste the noise that you saved in step 3 
over the result of the declick, but invert the saved 
noise that you're pasting. This causes the
noise to cancel out, leaving just the crackle, but inverted. 
-
6. Now mix-paste that inverted crackle back into 
the original file. Because the crackle is inverted, 
it cancels the crackle in the original file. 
-
It really does work rather well, but remember that 
it only works for background light crackle; it doesn't 
deal with big pops and clicks.
