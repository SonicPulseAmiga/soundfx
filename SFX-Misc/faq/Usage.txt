Q:

A:
In the new version you can select it from a menu. Further you will be able to
select ranges on the ruler (these are then always full width/height).
Q:

A:
This is currently only for zooming.

Q:

> execute, but something to start the calculation)
A:
there is one. press 'Enter'.

* select all is a easy one, I'll do it tonight (incl. the shortcut R-AMIGA+A)

Q:

A:
I think the best would be to make all short-cut user definable - meanwhile I
will make 'Del' a second shortcut for 'Cut'

A:
If there is no romm in memory, sfx tries to get it onto hd and
if there is no room, the operation fails. I have to store it somewhere. If you
have some ideas, they're welcome. Just to mention it I already thought about
reusing the space of the source. This works with most fx, but not with all and
is hard to handle.

A:
The operators are started as separate tasks. Most other windows are not, there
more like requests. As I don't run them assynchrounously, all events you cause
for othere windows are queued until you close the blocking window.
-
I don't know if it is worth the work, to make them all asynchrounous.

A:
yes, as this is exactly what it is for.
