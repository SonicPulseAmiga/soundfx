!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EXCLUSIVE VERSION ON AMINET CD-ROM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Important :

This version of SoundFX (SFX) is not public domain. Only the owner of this
AmiNet CD-Rom has the permission to use it.


Restrictions :

This version displays a requester after starting and before ending the pro-
gramm. Furthermore it enables only saving 8bit uncompressed sounddata. These
sounds are more noisy compared to 16bit.
And its only a version compiled for 68000`er CPU.
But as an advantage to the standart-demo-version you can save samples.


Advantages of a (real) registerred version :

You can choose what version (for what CPU/FPU) you want to get (a fpu-version
is up to 10 times faster !). Furthermore the registered version is optimized
for additional speed.
And of course no limitations, no requests !

How to order the full version !

I offer you a special upgrade price. Therefore you have to fill and to print
out the registration form (or write me a letter with the needed information)
and to send / transfer me the money, BUT you have to pay ONLY a lower PRICE !
Additionally you must enclose you AmiNet CD-Rom cover (NO COPIES !).
I only mark it on the backside and you will get it back with your full regis-
tered version.

standart price :
	30.00 DM
	25.00 US$
	15.00 £
	 5 bars gold pressed latinum =8-)

special price (the one for you):
	20.00 DM
	15.00 US$
	10.00 £

The payment could be cash or transfering the money to the following account.
