The problem is that the gadget list passed via WA_Gadgets is always appended
*after* the window's own system gadgets, which thus get an higher priority and
are always "reached" first by a mouse click. You need to make sure your
iconify gadget is inserted before the system gadgets; this can be achieved
for instance with the following code:

   RemoveGadget(win,iconifygad);
   AddGadget(win,iconifygad,0);

after the window has opened. You could also just add it at this point without
even inserting it into the initial gadget list, but having it there as well
helps keeping GUI enhancers happy (see also TBITest.c in the class archive).

Kind regards,
