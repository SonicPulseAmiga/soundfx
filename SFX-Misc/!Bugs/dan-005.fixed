Clipboard saving

Samples are not saved correctly to the clipboard! Try saving
a sample (no matter which unit you choose) and then load it
back - your sample will miss its beginning and will have some
crappy data appended at its end.

The "result" of this bug is dependent on whether you save the
sample as IFF 8SVX or 16SV. In the latter case the sample's
frequency will be crippled, too.
