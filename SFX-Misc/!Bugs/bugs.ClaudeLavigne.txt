All the operators pages are looking for folder node02.01.06 in folder node02.01.06.
And apart from the very last done page, there is no way to get to the operators pages.

I corrected the links on the operators page, at least now we can go "next". An index page would be nice.

I join the corrected pages (courtesy of "replace", find it on aminet) with this message, and i mail it to Stefan too in case the attachment is deleted from here.

Skimming of this mailing list for inclusion somwhere is begun, more about that soon.
