Hi.

1.To those that care, you may remember that mail with the png files about
  low CPU usage of SFX.  I found the cause for this was the "virtual 
  memory" menu setting "blocksize" (for HD buffering). Putting this general
  setting there was misleading, and the default(?) value there, 4k, was 
  way too low. Increasing it made the HD accessing speed, together with the
  CPU usage, increase by 500 percent. 
  A small drawback remains-values above 64k don't work properly when loading 
  samples.

2.I would like a "flush all windows" option affecting all samples with opened 
  window, leaving all boxified samples untouched.

3.The suggestion of flushing and deleting source files may be obsolete 
  with SFX using separate in and out directories, if it ever will. 

4.I today tried to batch process a heap of files that had specific necessary 
  names, and got a heap of 150 files with cluttered names from old processing
  sessions. Yes, I should have known but "Oh no!" (there is a nice Oh no! by 
  Tim Allen, home improvement, on the net). I had to redo the same batch by hand. 
  Stefan,  please remove this naming shit, and make SFX using the names it gets 
  from the file names on HD.
  In case of saving, especially batch saving, I suggest choices of 1.HD source
  name with HD source suffix, 2. with custom suffix, 3. with soundformat suffix,
  4. HD source name with or 5. without the processing-added "00", "01", "000".
  Btw., I know good comfort means higher effort for the coder of a program.

Regards,

Michael
