Hello Stefan

The review is all done and sent off. The only thing I criticised really
was the design of the toolbar icons.  For example, a picture of 2 pieces
of paper doesn't suggest making a new sample window from the selected
region, does it?

Also, the padlock looks almost exactly the same locked and unlocked. The
white outline makes it hard to see.



Suggestions:
A project -> New facility, giving a blank sample (user specifies length,
sample rate, depth) suitable for pasting into.

A Cancel button in each operator window. Of course you can just close
the window, but that is not so good ergonomically.

In the Amplify operator, it would be nice if  you could draw the sample in the
vector editing window.  (That would help in other operators too.)  Of
course in a different colour from the vectors.

In the Additive synth, the Overtone (not Obertone !) sliders are
invisible. Triangles?



It seems most of the bugs are in the virtual memory code.  When I
(deliberately) tried to load a sample bigger than the disk space, I got
lots of "recoverable" alerts and then a crash.


I had forgotten how low the price is.  The user gets a hell of a lot of
program for the money.
