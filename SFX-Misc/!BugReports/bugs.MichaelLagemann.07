  Yes.
  But, theoretically it could, via a second menu entry "flush all-delete",
  delete source sample files on the HD.
  Optionally being able to do this on a directory of 150 source files, so
  each already processed file gets cleared up, that was what I thought of.
  This would save effort. For example not not having to, X times, switch
  screen to Dopus and search for the source file, delete it and switch back,
  when using two directories. And it would speed up working.
  Thinking about the topic...one project menu entry "flush all open-delete)",
  one "flush all open", and one "save all boxified" would be nice :).
  Maybe all of this sounds strange, but that's the way I would process
  large heaps of source files into different named results.

  Yes, naturally it is that way now.

  Hm, that would interfere with SFX 4.2 using two directories for loading and
  saving, wouldn't it?. I personally prefer to use just two directories, one
  "in" and one "out". Most of the directory handling is done via Opus.

  Yes, I saw how it works, and got the hang of it at a sufficient level imho.
  The problem is not that I don't understand how it works, but just that the
  way it works...sucks. ;)

  Right, that's it, the name annotation at the end of the file. What for?
  It's just hindering the work here.
  1.I load a sample first time ever, "wasted-by-clipping fart from dumbonet 22khz 8bit.wav".
  2.After processing I rename it on saving to "Fart 24(.aifc)".
  3.I reload it next session, and voila, "wasted-by-clipping fart from dumbonet
    22khz 8bit.003", or something like that pops up.

  What did I give it a specific name on HD then, if it's disregarded. Am I using Winbloat?
  And what's the use in now having to memorize the HD name now, and with more loaded files
  even more names? And if I should fail at that, I can't replace the source file, if
  I want to, I can't delete the source file, and I may have wasted time and effort and have
  to repeat processing of that file. Because I don't know if the replacement is finished
  and saved yet, and which of the windows the replacement is.

  And with batch processing "Fart 1.aifc" to "Fart 35.aifc", I would get 35 files named
  "foouurt from dumbonet.001.wav", fiiirt from dumbonet.04.wav", "blast from dumbonet.03.wav".
  Which of these would be "Fart 12.wav"? I recently did it manually then...lots of files,
  several operators.
  Stefan, do you understand now why I don't want this annotation thing? I just can't work
  with that.

  Kind regards,

  Michael
