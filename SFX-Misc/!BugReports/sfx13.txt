Hello.

I have found the following bugs in SoundFX:

When I press the left Alt or either Shift key in the range window without a
sample already loaded, SoundFX locks up, but with a sample already loaded, a
requester appears asking me if I want to remove all samples, which continues
to appear when I choose 'NO', and choosing 'YES' makes SoundFX lock up.

When I press the left Amiga key in the range window, the miscellaneous prefs
window appears, and when I choose 'OKAY' or click on the close gadget, SoundFX
locks up.

When I press the right Alt or Amiga key, or the F1-F10 keys in the range
window, SoundFX locks up.

When I press the Control key in the range window, the savers window closes and
without a sample already loaded SoundFX locks up, but with a sample already
loaded, a requester appears asking me if I want to remove all samples, which
continues to appear when I choose 'NO', and choosing 'YES' makes SoundFX lock
up.

A full or clean boot makes no difference.

David M. White.
