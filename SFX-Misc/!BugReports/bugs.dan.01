Hello Stefan!

Here is the promised list of bugs and suggestions. I hope to
be able to test SFX more intensively in the near future, and
at last on a decent machine! (My dealer has promised to deliver
my new 060 card next week.)

News. Dave O'Reilly, the author of SoundProbe, gives up the development
of this (great) program. He spoke positively about SoundFX (wishes
you good luck with the development), and would be most probably willing to
give you the sources of SoundProbe's effects. I advise you to
contact Dave and ask him about it. The number of SFX's operators
would increase drastically this way!

                       SOUNDFX 3.82 BUGREPORT
                     by Daniel Jedlicka, Jan 2000


1.  I have spotted a great difference in behaviour of SFX compiled for
various  processors. I have tested a 030/nonFPU and a 040/FPU version,
on the following configurations:
- A4000, EC030/25, 2MB Chip, 16MB Fast, CVision64/3D (Picasso96 2.0)
- A12OO, Blizzard 040/40/FPU, 2MB Chip, 32MB Fast, AGA
The 040/FPU version was quite stable and nice to work with, except for
Virtual  Memory  (permanent  crashes when trying to load a sample) and
MPEG saver (saves strange files into strange places on the disk).

The  030/nonFPU  version is, on the other hand, completely unusable on
my  A4000.  It  crashes  any  time I try to load a sample into RAM (no
matter  what sample format it is). It opens the samplewindow, displays
sample  name,  playback  rate  and  length,  but  then  ends up with a
#80000004  system  error.  I had the same problem with 3.81. I use the
Universal loader, correct binaries and their respective libraries.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Why  is  there  still  "SoundFX  3.81"  in  the  screenbar and the
Information window? (v3.82, 030/nonFPU version). This is confusing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  The sfxsupport.libraries (030/nonFPU) for 3.81 and 3.82 differ (at
least  in  size),  yet  they both have the same version: 1.30. This is
strange.  When  a  library changes, its version/revision number should
change too. Otherwise we end up in a mess.
Also,  I  suggest  more  transparent  handling of the version/revision
identification.     Each    processor-specific    version    of    the
sfxsupport.library  should,  when read with the DOS "Version" command,
say e.g. "sfxsupport.library 1.30 (040/FPU)".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Personally,  I  don't  care  much  about the 030 version. The EC030/25
processor  in  my  A4000  is only a temporary matter, as I am about to
upgrade  (060/66).  Frankly  speaking,  the  030 is far too slow for a
decent  work with 16bit samples, and I believe anyone working with SFX
these  days has at least a 040. I suggest you DON'T bother at all with
a 030-binary when compiling the coming SFX 4.0. It will make your life
easier. :)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  There  are  frequent  spelling  mistakes  in  both the program and
the  documentation.  They should be fixed at least in the program. The
list of misspellins follows.

Edit-Menu: Cut to begin, Grab to begin etc.
There  is nothing like "begin" among English nouns. "Begin" is a verb!
Cut to beginning is correct.

Arexx Operators: "Differentiate", NOT "Differenciate".

Prefs-Menu/Sample/SizeMode "Absolute", NOT "Absolut".

Operators/Equalize-FFT/Presets "Bass&TrebleBoost", NOT "Trebble".

Operators/Filter-FIRMatrix "Cut-Off", NOT "Cutt-Of".  "Resonance", NOT
"Resonancy".

Operators/Filter-StateVariable/Presets "TrebleBoost, NOT "Trebble".
"Resonance, NOT "Resonane".

Operators/Gamma/Presets "MoreTreble", NOT "Trebble".

Operators/Logic "Logic Operand", NOT "Operant".

Operators/Synthesize-Add/Mode  "Curr"  (meaning  "Current") instead of
(German) "Akt".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Some titles in the Operator windows do not fit into the window with
most fonts:

Operators/SampleSplit "Splitpos" exceeds the left window border.

Operators/SurroundEncoder "RearFilt" exceeds the left window border.

Operators/Filter-FIRMatrix  "Matrix" overwrites the part of the string
gadget (even with Trinomic.font).

I  use  SFX  in  800x600  mode,  with XEN 8 as default font. But these
problems occur with the standard Trinomic.font as well.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Once  you  checked "FreeMem" in Prefs/Miscellaneous you cannot get
rid  of it. Deselecting the checkbox and pressing Okay is no help; the
FreeMem information stays in the screen bar for ever. "MaxMem" has the
same problems.
