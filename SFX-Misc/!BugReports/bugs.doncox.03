Hello Stefan

One of the great features is in Analyse 2D, where you can measure the
pitch of an instrument sample. For example to C-3

But I find the display is very crowded at the bottom, while there is
usually very little audio above 2kHz.  So it would be nice in this
operator to have an option to display only up to XX kHz, expanding the
scale to fill the window with this range.  Then it would be easier to
measure the pitch accurately.

The grid showing octaves is very nice. 

Now, having found out what note a sample is, we need an option in Pitch
Shift to enter the current note on a keyboard display, and the desired
note also on a keyboard display.  That would be more useful in many
cases than a "Pitch Shift Factor".  Of course all it gives is a friendly
way to calculate the factor, but friendly helps.


Another thing that would make the program more friendly is a Cancel
button in each operator window. Closing the window has the same effect,
but is not so good ergonomically.
