Hello Stefan!

I've been busy lately so I couldn't follow what's happenning on the
mailing-list. I've downloaded the new beta just now, more testing at
home.

What I'm sending you is a bugreport concerning the PREVIOUS beta,
i.e. the one from last weekend. Maybe you've spotted some of these
bugs and fixed them already...

Here it comes.

---

1. Problem in the Zoom menu
Regardless of what is selected in the zoom-toolbar, the "1 pixel = 1
sample" menu-item always zooms in the y-direction only.
This bug was already in V4.1.

==> fixed

2. Panorama-4ch
There is a bug in the Panorama-4ch operator. The operator actually
produces a quadro sample, but it ends up with a "frozen"
progress-requester. The title of the requester is trashed when you
click on it (nonsense characters).
The bug have been introduced in V4.2.

==> fixed

3. Surround Encoder
The bug in the Surround Encoder seems to be even more serious. Any
attempt to encode a quadro sample leads to a nice Guru.
The bug have been introduced in V4.2.

==> fixed

4. Analyse-Spect2D
When I analyse a sample and get the spectrum window, a cross should
follow the mouse-pointer. However, in some positions of the pointer
SFX draws too many crosses. Maybe this has some purpose but I simply
don't get what it is...
This bug was already in V4.1.

==> no bug

5. Clipboard Saving
When saving to the clipboard as IFF-16SV, the progress-requester says
"Loading" instead of "Saving". Saving as IFF-8SVX is OK in this
respect.

==> fixed

6. Catalogs and orderforms
The Czech catalog is obsolete. I have consulted this with a Czech ATO
administrator, and he commented:
- The catalog does not reflect the changes in the Czech AmigaOS
localization introduced with OS3.5 (and available also for pre-3.5
systems). The name of the language has officially changed from
"cesky" to "czech".
- The catalog does not observe the rules of translation published by
ATO Czech on their homepage. Violations against the style guide as
well as translation mistakes have been made.
- ATO Czech therefore recommends removing this catalog from SFX
distribution.

I do not use the Czech localization of the OS, so I haven't noticed
this before. If you want I can translate the catalog again, according
to ATO rules. I am a translator by profession and some 170 strings
are not too much work for me. Just send me the original strings and
I'll do it.

The Polish orderform distributed with beta 2 is not an orderform.

Have fun,
Dan
