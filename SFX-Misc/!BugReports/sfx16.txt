Hi Stefan!

I just finished processing a lot of samples.
Most of the samples were saved as WAV files from Sound Forge (PC
program).
SFX put up an error message for about half of them, saying the
RIFF-WAV header was corrupt. Then they loaded in OK. So if you want to
look at some of these files, let me know and I can mail them to you.

I also had several crashes. I am working with an A2000 with 68040, 64
Megs fast RAM, CybergraphX in 800x600 display. The crashes seem to
happen when there are several buffers open. One came after I did
"Flush All", but this command did not give a crash again.

Requests: 
1. Please could the names of new buffers relate to the one they come
from. So if you process "Trumpet" it should give something like
"Trumpet_01". "Trumpet_01" should give "Trumpet_02", etc. I know this
needs a bit of intelligent coding- you will have to check that the
name isn't in use.

2. Amplify -> Max Vol was very useful with these samples. Could we get
the max vol for each channel separately? Sometimes L is much lower
than R, or vice versa.

3. How do you make a new, empty buffer to paste into?

4. Can you split a stereo sample into two separate mono samples, and
later recombine them?


Thanks for all your work. This is a very good program.
Kind regards
