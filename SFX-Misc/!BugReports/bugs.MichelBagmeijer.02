Hi Michel !

Thanx for those really complete bug-reports and ideas. Afterwards my reply:

At first, yes I make music. Unfortunately since I've started SFX, I rarely have
enough time to compose some tracks.


Now to the ideas. (relized in V3.70, which will be released in mid of june (hopefully))

* Info,(c),Author & Anoo are editable now
* why do you need a multidelete in clipboard window. After I've implemented the clipboard
  loader/saver, I found out that SoundFX and Multiview are the only programs I posses,
  which are using it.
* All the operators are already asynchronous. Maybe I'll make some more windows asyn-
  chronous, like
		Info
		Sampleoptions
* I am already thinking about a preview. Maybe you can tell me what you think about it.
  I though that I add a 'prehear' checkbox in each operator-window and when you select it,
  a part of the current selected source is played in loop-mode. When you change a parameter
  the part is rerendered and you will heare it more or less instantaneous (depends on what
  FX and the length f the range).
  The problem I have is, what range should I play ? I can't use the mark or zoom, because
  that could be quite long or not set (in case of mark).
* I've included the CPU/FPU stuff
* I've changed that filename-handling. You were absolutely right about that. It was easy to
  do too, due to the universal-loader SoundFX knows about the extentsions of each loader,
  so it keeps the extension, if it is an non-standart one.
* My own virtual memory routines are already working. They are fully asynchronous. Loaders
  and Savers are up to 5 times faster with them. Edittools are ported as well and I am
  halftrough with the operators.


Questions

* I know that the price for SoundFX+Symphonie is too high, but he don't listen ... 
  (I get just 35,-DM out of it)
* %% means per thousand (1/1000), where % is per cent (1/100)
* all samples are loaded to fastram
* you can change your defaults module settings, by saving the preset as "default.prefs"
* Sample-stretch
	* e.g. by a factor of 3.2
	* do a resample by 3.2 and then a pitchshift by 3.2, change the sampling rate back
	  to the former
	* e.g. by a factor of 0.7
	* do a pitchshift by 0.7 and then a resample by 0.7, change the sampling rate back
	  to the former
* revealing the API of my libraries, makes it impossible for me to distribute it as
  shareware (crackers could write operators which save samples to disk)

Bugs

I have checked all bugs in the report and succesfully fixed most which I can reproduce.

* I've changed those datemismatches
* the speedbar is placed absolutely correct on my machine
* I can't do anything about, that the guidewindow is not activated, when pressing help.
* Now then parent-window is blocked, when you click on a pop-up-button (sourceselect,
  modulation, etc.)
