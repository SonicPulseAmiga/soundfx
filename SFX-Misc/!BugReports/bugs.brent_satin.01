Hi, I went to use SoundFX today to pitch shift some files....only to 
find it would not load ANYTHING properly.  I use the latest public 
full release....4.0, I think.

When I load an audio file, of ANY size, only the first few seconds of 
the waveform load....the full duration is there, but the last three 
quarters of the waveform is blank...i.e. zero volume.  Occassionaly 
when loading some audio files Sound FX freezes the Amiga completely.  
It loads the audio file, opens a window to display the waveform, and 
freezes before drawing the waveform.

I have tried:

- shutting off virtual memory,
- using the 'manual' loaders instead of the universal loader
- trying every type of audio file and format imaginable
- changing my AHI settings,
- using native Paula audio
- disabling my soundcard,
- disabling my WBstartup programmes
- disabling all patches in my startup sequence
- re-installing from the orignal SoundFX archive
- loading sounds from different drives
- changing buffer size in the Virtual Mem Prefs.
 
I would like to try one of the newer betas, but cannot find the 
location to download them....I have searched this e-mail group, to no 
avail for a file or a working ftp address.

Brent
