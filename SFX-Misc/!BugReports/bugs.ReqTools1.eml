Salut Claude,

The problem I have with the Path saving is not when I boot from the CD.

When I changed the Path in the preference window there is no change, the
Path remain at progdir:, nothing to do with saving since the change is not
done at all.

I found the cause of the problem... I'm using reqtools.library, don't know
if theres is something wrong with it or only in the way SoundFX is looking for the
result of my choice.

Thank you.

Bye!
