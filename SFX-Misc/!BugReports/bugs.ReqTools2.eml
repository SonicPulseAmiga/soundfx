I tried it again and something has changed now....

Hey, you found bugs :-) Now I can confirm it and extend the bug. Seems to be
an ugly bug, because it appears only "sometimes". After first start with SFX
and than choose a different Loader/Saver-Path the bug happens.
After checked some other SFX-Requester (choose LogPath gives also hits), I
noticed that the enforcer-hit with Loader/SaverPath was gone. The "goal" is if
you choose or changed? the VMem SwapPath and go to Loader/Saver-Path, it works
(no hit). Except the LogPath makes allways a hit.

I`m using reqtools 39.3 (15.11.2001), too (I think the most do).


ps: At the moment I`ve found three more bugs plus some old ones (hope to added
it to bugtracker soon).

pps: Stefan: I remember you planed a Test-Script, what about it? I ask,
because it is extrem time expensive to test all SFX-Operators. I never check
much Operators (only a few I use and some which reported problems). The Script
can help much, or not?
