Hello everyone!

> * I'll do undo/redo for cut/copy/paste-stuff someday.

Perfect, thanks a lot! Not just for this one, but for all the improvements
you have mentioned in the status report.


> * select all is an easy one, I'll do it tonight (incl. the shortcut
> R-AMIGA+A)

Superb. And please, could you implement it, too, as a menu command (in the
Edit menu) or a button in the toolbar?


Question:
Stefan, you have mentioned that a range can get unmarked from a menu.
Which menu command does this? I can't find any...


Bug-report:
I really hate being the bad guy who floods the poor author with bugreports
(I know Stefan has a full-time job}, but nevertheless, I have another one 
;)

1. The Shorten operator does not work, no matter what parameters I set.
It starts and DOES the calculations, but then it doesn't open any window
with the result. Strange.

2. The ZeroPass operator is buggy, in two ways:
a/ It does not remember the current FadeOut parameter. When I ZeroPass
something (setting both FadeIn and FadeOut to some values) and then bring
up the operator again, the FadeIn parameter stays the same as in the last
operation, but the whole FadeOut gadget becomes cleared.

b/ The operator works, but when Enforcer is running, hits are reported
(illegal LONG-reads) and the operation won't finish; I have to reset my
computer.

I'd like you people here to check this on your machines. I use an 040/fpu
version of SFX.

Thanks for your comments regarding Undo and SelectAll. But what do you
think about the Del key? I'm used to use it for Cut operations, just like
SoundForge, CoolEdit, and also word-processors have it...

Daniel
