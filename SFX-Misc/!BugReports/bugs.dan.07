Hello again!

This is the outcome of my first afternoon with SoundFX 4.2 Beta
Release 2.


1. Saving in the demo

Stefan, have you realized that you CAN SAVE SAMPLES IN THE
DEMOVERSION?!!!
Anybody without a keyfile is now able to save his work! The toolbar
Save is inactive in the demo as it should be, but the Project menu
allows saving without any restriction! (This bug was present already
in the first 4.2 beta). I recommend removing the beta from the FTP as
soon as possible!

==> fixed

2. Inaccurate size setting

In Prefs/Sample you can set the default preferences for your samples.
Among others you can specify the sample-window size. But the values
you enter DO NOT correspond to the real window size that will be
used!

Switch to the "absolute" mode and enter the window size in pixels.
You'll see that your windows are bigger than this. Switch to the
"relative" mode and enter "500" for both XSize and YSize. You'll see
that the window size is definitely NOT 50% of the screen size.

==> it the inner size of the window which it is related to.

BTW, wouldn't it be more "human" to specify the size in per cent
instead of per thousand? Let's be more user-friendly here.

==> hmm, when toggling between both setting sfx is converting it,
    with % the value does change noticable when switch back and forth

It also seems to me that the size values for windows in the zoomed
state are ignored. Regardless of what I enter, the zoomed window size
is always the same.

==> fixed


3. Default paths for samples

I think that the way SoundFX handles default sample-paths is
completely insane. What's the point of setting default paths when
every loaded/saved sample changes this setting? For example, I have
an assign SAMPLES: on my HD where I normally store all my samples (in
various directories). Therefore I want to set SAMPLES: as my default
load/save path in SFX. But sometimes it is necessary to load/save
from/to a different path, eg. from a CD or to a ZIP disk. In this
case SFX overrides my settings with the new paths, and if I happen to
save the prefs (eg. after changing something in the GUI), the new -
UNWANTED! - settings are stored with the config, and I have to
restore them again in the Sample prefs.

I believe that DEFAULT paths should be set and changed only by the
user. I have never seen a program where the user's defaults are
overridden this way. Just look at how this is done in OctaMED (menu
Settings/Miscellaneous/Default Directories).

4. Misspellings

Project/Information:
Your copyright is outdated (says 1993-2000).

Project/Batch Processor:
"Modul" should be replaced with "module".

Prefs/Sample:
Size mode "absolut" should be "absolute".
Unit Y cycle-item "dezibel" should be "decibel".
Safe Check cycle-item "ever" should be "always".

==> fixed

5. Possible hang-up with MaxVol

See my comment on the mailing-list.

==> fixed

6. Invalid dir

At startup you try loading "titlebar.image" from LIBS:Classes/Images.
This way you'll never load it - the correct path is LIBS:Images/. If
the user (like me) does not have Classes/Images/titlebar.image in his
SoundFX PROGDIR:, the sample-windows will not have the iconify
gadget.


7. Strange preset behaviour

The operator presets:
Filter-StateVariable - BeatFX1, BeatFX2, BeatFX3, Sweep

Synthesize-Add - LaserShot

==> works here

still produce a zero waveform, both under WinUAE and AmigaXL. Really
strange.

That's all for today, I'll do more testing at the weekend.

Regards,
DAN
