Hello Stefan!

Oh great, thanks. You're a wonder (I've been always been saying
that...).

Oh I see. Sorry, I forgot to bring them with me today (I still don't
have internet at home and have to go to the univarsity computer lab).
Will send them next time.


> About the requester, have a look at ReqAttack.
OK I will. I've just downloaded the archive.

Yes but this adds workspace at the end only. Have a look at
SoundProbe: it offers adding space at the beginning, at the end, and
before a selected range. Much more functionality, and still very easy
to implement.

I thought this would be tricky with FX, that's why I recommended
doing it via the "Add Workspace" menu item. Think about it once more,
please... (at least, this could be a feature for V4.3...)


And now some new bugs.

---

1. Loader & Saver prefs menu delay

I'll lead you to the bug in steps so that you can follow easily:
a/ Run SFX.
b/ Select a loader that has prefs (eg. CDDA, RAW, MPEG) and open the
prefs-window. Press RMB and look at the menu. No problem here.
c/ Do the same with a saver prefs-window. Again, no problem - the
menu is displayed correctly.
d/ Now load or generate a sample and repeat steps b/ and c/. Still
everything's fine.
e/ PLAY the sample...
f/ ...and repeat steps b/ and c/. You'll see the bug - the menu
appears after a 3-4 second delay.

==> not happening here

The operator-window menus are displayed correctly.
The bug was there already in V4.1.


2. MPEG prefs

There's a misspelled heading in the MPEG prefs-window. Too many
"&"-signs.
The bug was there already in V4.1.

==> fixed

BTW, do you know of the Music-DSP source code archive at
www.musicdsp.org/? If not you should definitely have a look at it.
I believe you could get some inspiration there.

Regards,
DAN
