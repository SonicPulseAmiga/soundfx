Hello!

I know I promised not to send any more bugreports this week,
but I just can't stand waiting for Monday. :)
After all, the sooner we get rid of bugs the better for us all...

SFX BUGREPORT
Daniel Jedlicka
August 5, 2000



FATAL BUGS


1. Clipboard saving

Samples are not saved correctly to the clipboard! Try saving
a sample (no matter which unit you choose) and then load it
back - your sample will miss its beginning and will have some
crappy data appended at its end.

The "result" of this bug is dependent on whether you save the
sample as IFF 8SVX or 16SV. In the latter case the sample's
frequency will be crippled, too.


2. CDDA-Direct loader prefs

On my system, selecting the CDDA-Direct loader and then clicking
on the loader-prefs button causes SoundFX to lock up.
(Busy-pointer appears, the prefswindow does not pop up).

I have an old quad-speed Mitsumi CD-ROM, connected via standard
Amiga IDE and atapi.device. Well, the drive does not support
grabbing audiotracks, but I think this fact should not prevent
SFX from opening the prefswindow...



NON-DESTRUCTIVE BUGS


1. Equalize-FFT-3D

Opening the Equalize-FFT-3D operator window (both via pop-up
and "E") causes four Enforcer hits. These are BYTE-READS
from 00000000 to 00000003, which looks like accessing a bad
string pointer.


2. Window refresh problems

Opening some program windows causes bad refreshing of 
sample-windows when they are resized. If you open eg. a loader
prefswindow, and then attempt to resize a sample-window,
its contents is not properly refreshed. The refresh is
completed only after you have closed the loader prefswindow.

Operator windows DO NOT cause this! The refreshing is performed
without any problems when an operator window is open.

The bug appears on all OCS and AGA displays. Could you people
with other gfx-systems (CGX, Picasso96) try this on your machines?


3. IFF-AIFF saver prefswindow

If you open the IFF-AIFF saver's prefswindow and then try
to close it via closegadget, the window is NOT closed, but
a filerequester pops up, letting you save the sample. :-)
All other savers' prefswindows are OK in this respect.

Cheerio,
Daniel
