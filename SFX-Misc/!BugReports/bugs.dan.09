Hello Stefan!

I did a stupid thing. I re-installed my emulator filedisk
in order to get a clean installation of 0S3.9 (and I created two more
with OS3.1 and 3.5, for SoundFX testing). I backed-up my fonts,
libraries... but I forgot one important directory - DEVS:Keyfiles.
Sorry to bother, but would it be possible to generate a new SFX
keyfile for me? ;-) My reg.nr. was 1300 or so as I remember. Thanks,
hope it's not a big problem!

Now a few comments on your last mail.

Thanks for fixing the reported bugs. (You'll find another report,
hopefully not a long one, at the end.)

Now I see how it works! Thanks for explanation.

I will, no problem.

This would be a little bit more tricky. I'll explain how ShowTip
handles the catalog. String #0 contains the total number of
tip-strings in the catalog - it is actually a string of digits that
ShowTip converts via atoi(). This number specifies the range of
strings ShowTips can choose from, via rand(). Strings #1 and #2 are
reserved for the Title and Gadget text of the requester. Thus, tip
messages start from catalog string #3.

Including the tips.catalog in soundfx.catalog would be possible but I
think having it separate is more practical. I really wouldn't mix the
two things together. Both you and I can add new catalog strings
freely, without having to rewrite ShowTip each time you change
something in the main catalog.
But of course I'll send you the catalog source so that you can
include your tips.


> About the last version of ShowTip. What do you use for the requests ? Can you make the "Ok" button default, so it can be invoked by pressing Enter ?
Well, I doubt that. I use the requester.class for displaying the
messages. I've chosen this class because the requesters look good and
are displayed centered on the screen. But the class seems to be
unfinished in some parts, and I'm afraid that keyboard shortcuts for
buttons are among the unfinished features. I've told Haage&Partner
about this but it seems they have other things to do. I might try
other solutions: Intuition or reqtools.library. In fact, I may
include all three solutions in ShowTip and let the user choose the
one he prefers... What do you think?

Sure, do any changes that are necessary. My code was just an example
of how it could be done, I don't claim any copyrights for it. :-)
Good to hear that you like identify.library.

Now the promised report #4.

1. ChannelJoin

This time I have spotted a nasty bug in the ChannelJoin operator. Try
this: load a mono sample, select ChannelJoin and join the sample with
itself. No problems, are there? Now perform an Edit operation on the
original mono sample - for example, cut out a portion. Then join this
sample with itself just like you did before. See the bug?

Perform some more operations on the original sample: Paste, Zero,
Erase... With the exception of Copy and Grab, all Edit operations
cause ChannelJoin to distort the lower part of the resulting stereo
sample.

Operations performed via operators (like Shorten, ZeroPass etc.) do
not cause this problem.

===> fixed

2. No room for reverberation
SoundFX produces quality delay and reverb effects. Unfortunately, the
effects do not add any room for reverberation at the end of the
sample. The result sounds quite unnatural: the sample ends "too
soon", before the reverberation fades out smoothly.

There are basically three ways to make it better:

a/ The operator calculates how much extra room the reverberation
needs at the end, and adds this room automatically. Thus, the
resulting sample is longer than the original. This is how most DSP
programs do it, but in SoundFX there would be a slight problem: you
wouldn't be able to ChannelJoin the original and the result into a
stereo sample because of the length difference.

b/ The operator offers a parameter by which the user can specify how
much workspace (in seconds, bytes...) should be added at the end of
the sample.

c/ Do it just like good old AudioMaster does it: put an "Add
Workspace" item to the Edit menu. Selecting this item would open a
requester window where the user can select the length of the
workspace. After clicking "OK" the active sample gets the specified
extra zero bytes at the end.

Personally, I vote for alternative c/ as it is the easiest to
implement and still quite practical. Alternative b/ would mean
rewriting the operators as well as their GUI.

===> no bug

This is all for today. I'll have a look at the ShowTip requesters
during the weekend.

Dan
