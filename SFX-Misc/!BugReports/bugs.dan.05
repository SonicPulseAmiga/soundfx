Hello Stefan and everyone who reads this!

I have, as usual, done quite thorough testing of the new beta.

The first words go to Stefan. Thanks for the time and effort you have 
invested in this release! I am sure that the internal changes were 
necessary and that SoundFX, already being an above-standard package, 
is going for a quantum leap with the release of V5.

I appreciate the changes you have made to the Help menu. Immediate 
access to the SFX homepage and direct mailing are, for sure, useful 
features. I also like that Help is now the last menu in the strip: 
for me this seems more logical.

The things I want to report, discuss or suggest here can be divided 
into three groups: bugs, cosmetic changes, and suggestions. Comments 
are welcome.


1. PROBLEMS OF COSMETIC NATURE

Some people perhaps don't care about how programs look. I'm an 
aesthetically-founded person and therefore am unhappy when a cute 
program does not LOOK cute. Starting with V4 SoundFX began to look 
cute, and my friends stopped asking me "How can you work in this four-
colour-window-mess?". Thanks, Stefan. Yet there are things that could 
be improved.

A) Hi-/true-color functionality

Does anybody here use SFX in hi-color or true-color resolutions? On 
my two "virtual Amigas" (WinUAE and AmigaXL) SoundFX does not handle 
colours properly on 16/32bit screens (8bit screens up to 256 colours 
are OK). The horror comes when you go to the GUI Prefs and start 
playing with the palette. Stefan, it seems that the system gadgets 
you use here are not able to cope with 16/32bit palettes, as they do 
not refresh themselves properly. Using OS3.5+ gadgets might be a 
solution, and should not be left out of the question.

Tested with Picasso96. Do CyberGraphX screens do the same?

=====> I use Picasso96 too. For SFX I mainly use plain gadtools gadgets - no hacks.
I've just tried it. The only problem I noticed is, that the palette gadget
in prefs/gui do not update. Hmm, at the moment I have no idea, how to fix
that behaviour.

B) Buffers-toolbar handling

The Buffers-toolbar (see Help chapter 1.3.6) shows the name of the 
active sample. The drop-down gadget located next to the name opens a 
list of all samples you have loaded. Here you can activate the sample 
you want.

Stefan: is there a way of making also the sample WINDOW active (just 
like you would do it by clicking on the window)? Would a call to 
intuition.library's function ActivateWindow() make it possible?

=====> done

And second: is it necessary to open the list when there is only one 
sample present? It really looks awful when there's just one sample 
and you click on the drop-down (the list has not enough space to 
display its gadgets). I believe that when there is less than two 
samples (= there is nothing to choose from) the drop-down gadget 
should stay inactive so that no list is displayed.

=====> I now ask gadtools to hide the arros and scrollers from the
listview if all entries are visible.

C) Filter-FIRMutate palette problems

The headlines "Effect", "Filter Offset" and "Filter Stretch" (see the 
operator window) are drawn using an inappropriate colour. It seems 
that SFX draws these headlines with ColorTextGlow instead of the 
ColorText colour.

=====> fixed

D) Inconsistent/non-standard terminology

I raised this up about a year ago. While certain terminology problems 
can perhaps be tolerated in the manual, they can't be overlooked when 
present in the menu.

Stefan: it is a bit confusing that in the Project menu you speak 
of "ranges" (Play Range) and in the Edit and Range (!) menus you call 
the same thing "marks". Let's be consistent and use standard 
terminology: replace MARKS with RANGES.

=====> a range is either marked/zommed area (in this order)

Second: let's have the menu in good English! I believe 
that "Cut/Copy/Paste etc. to BEGIN" is nonsense for an English 
speaker (or, rather, it has a different meaning: "Cut something in 
order to begin some activity"). You really should replace it 
with "Cut to beginning".

======> fixed

And third: the MultiDelay operator window has "Feedback" instead 
of "Fb Local" in Delay 7 and Delay 8 sections.

=====> fixed


2. BUGS

A) Misbehaving presets

Some operator presets do not work properly: they produce a zero-
waveform! The presets I have found so far are:
Filter-StateVariable - BeatFX1, BeatFX2, BeatFX3, Sweep
Synthesize-Add - LaserShot


B) Sample-options context menu STILL not updated correctly

Some people (like me :-) leaped with joy when Stefan introduced the 
sample-options context menu. This feature is very helpful and 
convenient (especially for people with 3-button mice). Unfortunately, 
there's a bug there. Sorry, Stefan, but it's still there!

Load a sample with no loop. Go to the context menu (press the middle 
mouse button if you have it) and select "Loop". Loop-points are 
displayed in the sample-window. Go to the context menu again. Do you 
see the dot signalling that the loop is ON? Fine. Now deselect the 
loop. The dot in the menu disappears, as well as the loop-points in 
the window.

So far everything has worked fine. But watch this: go to the context 
menu and select "Loop" again (the dot appears because loop is now 
ON). Now use the toolbar and go to the Sample Options window. Can you 
see that the loop is set to "Forward"? Right. Now click on the cycle-
gadget and select "None" instead of "Forward". You'll see that the 
loop-points in the sample-window have disappeared (loop is now OFF). 
Close the Sample Options window and go to the context menu again. Now 
you can see the problem: the menu item displays the dot (= says that 
the loop is ON) although the loop is OFF!

The operations in the Range menu do not update the context menu, 
either! If you, for example, select a range and then choose "set loop 
like mark", the sample options window is updated correctly (loop is 
set to "forward") but the context menu is not (no dot is displayed).

=====> fixed

C) SFX is untidy

If you decide to record something (click the toolbar button), SFX 
creates an empty file called "sfx-record" in your SFX directory. Now 
close the Record window without recording anything, and quit SFX. 
You'll see that the empty (and useless) file still resides in your 
directory.

In other words: SFX behaves like a bad boy, throwing mess around. His 
mother should take action! :-)

=====> fixed

D) Applying effects to non-existing ranges

Load/generate a sample. Do not select any range. Then choose an 
operator, change the source cycle gadget to "Range" and run the 
operator. Here comes the bug! The progress requester freezes and 
won't disappear. No crash but you won't be able to quit SFX anyway.

All operators do this. I recommend deactivating the "Range" cycle-
item when there is no range selected. How can you operate on a range 
when there is none? ;-)

=====> fixed


E) Overriding source settings

Imagine this: you have a sample with a range and you select an 
operator. The source cycle gadget shows that the effect will be 
applied to the "Range". OK. Then you change your mind and decide that 
you wish to effect the WHOLE sample, so you switch the cycle 
to "All". Now you select a desired preset and what happens - SFX has 
overridden your setting and changed the cycle back to "Range"! This 
should not happen in my opinion. Presets should specify the operator 
parameters but not the sample portion to be effected - this choice 
should be left exclusively to the user.

=====> understood, that's probably bit more than what I could fix immediately.


F) Installation problems

Somebody has reported here that he had problems with installing 
V4.2beta. I also experienced this. When installing the beta under 
WinUAE (OS3.9) I got an error at line 837 (the Installer could not 
write to the file Sys:Prefs/Env-Archive/Installer/Programs/SFXPath) 
and I had to install the program manually. I tried different versions 
(040, 060) but no effect.

What is strange is that under AmigaXL (OS3.9) there was no problem at 
all and the installation ran smoothly.

Something fishy in the installation script? I can send a SnoopDOS log 
if it helps.

(oh yes... version 4.1 installed smoothly under both systems...)

=====> I tried to care about that.

3. SUGGESTIONS

A) I would appreciate if we could hide a sample directly from the 
Sample Options context menu, not only via the "box"-button in the 
toolbar. This should be really easy to implement.

=====> in sfx 4.2 beta 2 sample windows have a iconify button in
the window border (thanks to masimo/visual prefs).

--- 

All the problems mentioned here apply to the first betaversion of 
SoundFX 4.2 for 060/FPU.
The program was tested under Amiga OS 3.9, emulated under WinUAE 
0.8.17 Release 3, and under AmigaOS XL (QNX).

Dan Jedlicka
