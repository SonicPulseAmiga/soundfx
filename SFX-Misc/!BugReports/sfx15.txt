     Hello again,
     I have tested the new filters :

     1. FIR-HIPASS = seems OK

     2. FIR-LOPASS = Not OK : try to use it several times (2 or 3) with
     different cutoffs and passes , it will crash after having calculated
     the sample (not at the beginning)

     3. BandStop = Doesn't do anything !!!

     4. BandPass = works ok, but I have unfortunately tried with
     cutoff1=0.0000 and it does something like folding the sample. And
     after, the bug remains : if you change the cutoff1 to a value
     different from 0, it will still fold the sample.
