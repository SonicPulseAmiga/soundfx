BugReport SFX V4.00

Hi Stefan. This is another bugreport from DMX
I found a lot of bugs, more or less. These are not all of them. Just the ones I could find myself.
There might be a few bugs squashed already in a new version, but I can't check that myself for now.
Also included is a new version of Nederlands.ct.
To make a new cat file, remove all the NEW & CHANGE items.
I haven't done everything, but quite a lot.
Mail me if have any questions. E-Address below...


Samples that I use to make this report. I case you want to check it yourself.
- Korg/Trinity/Acjustikk1
- .minimoog/MBS_07.Wav

Bugs:

CDDA-Direct.guide:
Due to a very stupid bug in amigaguide this file can't be loaded. The comment is: can't open database.
I found the bug! It's because there's 1 return to little. Put it after (the last) @endnode. Now everything
works correctly again.

SFX:
! When Snoopdos3 (V3.4) is running, SFX doesn't start up.
  # I am using SnoopDos 3.0 RC (11.9.94) and it works fine #

? CDDA loading isn't working. When I select the questionmark, it's busy forever.
  If I select the map, it might work.
  Usually when snoopdos (V1.7) is on, starting after SFX.
  # What map ?, what do you mean by 'map'? 

* Loading an MPEG file isn't very successful either.
  The pitch is too high & the file isn't loaded all the way, even if the virt. mem is on.

? The Chorus-Phaser/EQ-FFT/MultiDelay/Synthesize-Add window is TOO BIG.
  Even with a screenmode of 1280*512 it goes off screen, bigtime.
  # What font ?#

! If there are no samples loaded, starting Synthesize-FM crashes, saying something 'bout odd data & Guru 80000003.
  Strangely everything works fine when a sample is loaded before Synt.-FM is started.
  # works here #


- SFX can't be quitted if there are still windows open. This is the disadvantage of a modular system!
  SFX doesn't/can't see 'crashed' operators.
  A solution is:
  ¹) Let SFX close every window it sees and then quit
  ²) Don't let SFX quit. Let the user close the windows & screen him/herself.
  After that let SFX try it again. 
  This is what I do (with SysInspector) if something happens.
  SFX should run fine if tried again.....

* Trying Pitchshift with the VOCAL settings crashed the operator (DEADEND).
  The error is in the pitchshift factor, which is "+4 st".
  If you put any other number there, like 1.0,2.0,4.0 or so, than everything works fine :)

* ConvertChannel: With this operator there's no checking on how many channels a sample really has.
  You can basically select anything you like.
  # An operator does not necessarily has to care about channels - #
  # all formats can be converted on the fly #

- Selecting Default or Reset is not working. Looks like it selects 'current' instead of 'default'.

- The Selection on the right hand side doesn't always load the settings correctly.

- Set dates set in (some of) the 2IDs-files are saying 1980 !!! Ex. © ..... 1993-1980 ;)

- Saving a sample to the Clipboard doesn't work to well either. All rubbish comes out.

* MAJOR BUG: If you put Anno to NIL, 0, Zero or so, then with 16SV,8SVX,AIFF,AIFC
  you can't save a sample anymore.
  Requester says: iff-xxxx_s.c 4xx  Can't write data !

- MAUD/WAV PCM24 & 32 save are broken. Only a (small) part is saved.

- SND-AU PCM24, 32, IEEE32 & 64 save are broken. Only a (small) part is saved.

- There is a loss of data at the end of the sample, when saving with 8SVX PCM32.
  This is not happening with 8,16 or 24.

- The Universal-Loader doesn't see SND-AU / VOC samples.

* When the length of the input in the Anno-Box, is an odd number, an extra space is added.
  Is this a bug, or does the length of this string always has to be an even number ?
  # was there due to restriction for IFF-files #

- Is VOC 8:3 broken too ?

- DeNoise-FFT good/preview quality files don't work. With them the output is just noise.

- Redesign the EQ-FFT 'sliders' & give them another pen-color. The default color is hardly visible.
  With redesigning I mean that there's a 0-line in the center of the Y-axis (if I'm right).
  Then make the sliders go from -200 to +200, instead of 0 to 400.
  This is also the case with the Synth.-Add 'sliders'.

- Please LOCK the EQ-FFT-3D settings if given by the user.

- MAJOR BUG: The 8 & 14 bit drivers don't play from the beginning.
  They start playing at around 5-60% of the sample, depended on the samplelength.

- Saving to MPEG (8hz) doesn't work either. The Guru (8000000B) displays himself again.
  This message is shown: LIB-SAVT.C 822: Can't open file !

- Hall/2ids_hallextrem doesn't work. ie. 'Can't allocate memory' -> Hall.c 792.
  Here the diff setting is too low !?!

! On the curve setting window, return doesn't close the window.

- The resample are a bit off, you know ? The resample-factor shouldn't be saved if a New SRat is given in.
  That why the ...to xxK filters can't do there
  jobs very well. Because the Samp.Factor makes the new SRat. But the Old SRat could be anything.

* SampleSplit: SplitPos keeps resetting itself to 50%
- Splits doesn't seems to work very well. If you put in 3, than you might get 2 or 4.
- SplitPos text is on the left out of the window.

- Shorten doesn't work at all.

- SurroundEnc.: RearFilt text is on the left out of the window.

- SurroundEnc.: Set Mode to Invert & Rearfilt Num to 8. Now SFX crashes bigtime. You don't have to set Mode to invert, but on my machine it makes
  the crash a bit bigger.

! ZeroPass: The fadeout number just disappears, empty....



Ideas:

- It would be nice if there were PPC-Plugins.
- What about an option that leaves the operator-window open & just starts the operator. Now when you don't like the outcome, you just change it without
  having to open the operator-window again. This can save a lot of time. + Playing the sample while the window is open, ofcourse.
- Keep the operator-selection in the middle. You might want to select an effect from the top. It's not good when you have to scroll up&down all the time :-|
  Especially when you want an effect which 1 or 2 above the effect just chosen. This happens to me a lot of times, believe me.
- Put the filters together and make a cycle-button for selecting them.
- Give some info on how people can make their own modules.
