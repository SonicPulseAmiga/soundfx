ShowTip for SoundFX
by Dan Jedlicka

History

0.1 (20 Jan 2002)
- The idea & the first working version (for Stefan's eyes only).
- Opens on "SFX-Pubscreen" only (provisional).
- Fully localizable (stores the tips in a locale catalog).
- Version 0.1 of the English catalog (30 entries).

0.2 (22 Jan 2002)
- The program now requires a commandline argument specifying the
  name of the screen to open on. Thus, if SFX is already running
  and the user starts another copy of the program, the tip-of-the-day
  should appear on the correct screen.
- Version 0.2 of the English catalog (minor corrections).

0.3 (26 Jan 2002)
- Implemented one more check on the catalog (= even safer now).
- Stores five recently displayed tips in "PROGDIR:Data/Recent.tips".
  This prevents displaying the same tips too often.
- Version 0.3 of the English catalog (reflects the changes in SFX4.2).

0.4 (27 Jan 2002)
- Linked with the latest version of stormamiga_nc.lib (saved some bytes).
- Added 2 more tips to the English catalog (V0.4)

0.5 (29 Jan 2002)
- Optimized the load/save routines and saved about 400 bytes :-)

0.6 (13 Feb 2002)
- Added Intuition EasyRequest support. Now, if the requester.class is not
  found (as it would be the case on pre-OS3.5 systems), ShowTip
  displays the tip message using a standard Intuition requester.

1.0 (28 Mar 2002)
- Added a call that activates SoundFX's screen after closing the requester.

1.1 (20 Apr 2002)
- Completely reworked. ShowTip doesn't use requester.class anymore,
  a custom ReAction-based display engine is used instead.
- Faster and better-looking.
- The requester can now be closed by pressing ENTER.

1.2 (21 Apr 2002)
- The minimum class version lowered from 42 to 41 in order to allow the use
  of ClassAct 2.0 distribution. (I assumed ClassAct 2.0 classes were at
  least V42 but I was wrong).
- Removed some forgotten debug code and saved about 2.5KB.
- Optimized the requester image. (It wasn't really necessary to keep it in
  256 colours so I saved it as a 16-colour image, thus making it smaller.)
