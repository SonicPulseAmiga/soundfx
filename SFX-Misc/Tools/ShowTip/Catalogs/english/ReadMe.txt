ShowTip catalogs - important!


String #000 MUST contain the number of tip strings. It is always the
last catalog string number minus 2. If you add or delete new strings,
do not forget to change the number appropriately!

String #001 is reserved for the requester heading text.

String #002 is reserved for the requester gadget text.

The tip strings start with string #003.

Lines are separeted by '\n'.

The maximum number of tip strings is 256 (this should be fairly enough).
