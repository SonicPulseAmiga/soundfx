Or "TBI_"   Please use the attached header file and include it *after*

Yes, while the rest of your NewObject() call should be ok as it is now.

The correct procedure to add a custom titlebar gadget to a window is:

- Create the sysiclass image passing just the screen's DrawInfo to
  NewObject(), do *not* specify the sizes with IA_Width/IA_Height,
  nor the position with IA_Left/IA_Top; this way the image will get
  automatically the correct position and size.

- Create the buttongclass gadget with the image as GA_Image, and
  pass { GA_Titlebar, TRUE } among its tags; this way the gadget
  will be automatically positioned (and sized) in the titlebar.

If you need, I can send you a small example source doing just that...

Sounds great, thanks
