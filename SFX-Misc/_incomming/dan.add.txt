Hello Stefan,

I have downloaded the final 4.2 version and installed it without any
problems.

Seems that some guys from the m-list had problems with getting the
right archive. I assume they downloaded an LHA archive, which is out
of date. It would be a good idea to deactivate the links to the old
archives until you replace them with the latest ones...

I have, again, written a short news article for the Czech Amiga News.
Also, as it seems there is no History file distributed with the
release, I wrote a list of changes (new features and bugfixes) so
that people can see the progress since V4.1. If you feel anything is
missing, just add it and send me the updated file back.

See the attachments.

If've been waiting for this moment more than for anything else!

Please do! And please instruct me how to write makefiles - I've never
done this as StormC doesn't use them. ;-)

You can be 100% sure about that.

> 2.) I have no plans for new loaders at the moment


I do have some plans. Not only have I collected a number of format
descriptions (SF2, XI, DLS, AVR, AVI audio, PAT, DWD...), I also want
to update the loader plugin engine to support multi-sample files
(like soundbanks and modules) in an intelligent way. My idea is as
follows:

- you load a file, e.g. a soundfont.
- the plugin reads the sample properties and finds that the file
contains e.g. 8 waveforms (if there is just one waveform, the plugin
loads it straight away).
- a window opens, showing a check-able ReAction listview with the
names of the samples (by default, all samples are checked)
- the user selects just the waveforms he wants to load, and presses
"Load"
- the desired waveforms are loaded into SFX

Similarly, I want to implement a Save All function. Let's say the
user has 6 samples open in SFX:

- he selects Save All from the Project menu
- a window opens, showing a check-able ReAction listview with the
names of the buffers (by default, all buffers are checked)
- it will be possible at this point to select/edit saving path and/or
to create a specific directory for the samples
- the user selects the buffers he wants to save, and presses "Save"
- the desired samples are saved

Right. The program will become smaller and less error-prone. Also, it
will be possible to run the prefs editor even without running SFX.
This is helpful e.g. before running SFX for the first time.

The Information window would probably be the next one.

Absolutely. You don't have to worry about re-sizing and
font-sensitivity.

Definitely not.

Yes, my idea was exactly the same. If anyone wants to develop a new
plugin, he can use the strings in the particular catalog, which will
be part of the developer package. If he needs to introduce some new
strings, he will contact you and you'll update the catalog source.

I wouldn't lose too much sleep about it for now. Just play the sample
from the beginning (CoolEdit does the same, BTW) and let it play for
some specific time. Realtime FX preview will be such a breakout on
the Amiga that people would gladly tolerate this limitation before
you come up with a new solution {based on FFT analysis?).



> and even trickier how to trigger playback from an operator


What's the problem exactly?

DAN
