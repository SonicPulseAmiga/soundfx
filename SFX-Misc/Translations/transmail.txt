finally I've got sfx-4.2 ready and the bugtracker is in a somewhat working
state too. The last two weeks I spent recovering my harddisk as my pfs2
partition crashed.

I would like to ask you if you can translate the new entries in the
in the installer text file, which is attached and mail it back to me.

Thanks a lot.

Stefan
