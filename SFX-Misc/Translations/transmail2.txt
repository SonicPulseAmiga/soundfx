hi hi,

thanks a lot for doing the translation for SoundFX. I've got the version 4.2
ready now (after extensive betatesting). To make the keyfile for you I need
your full address. Please mail it to me in reply.

I further ask you to translate the new text in the installer-messages
and fill the gaps in the catalogs (see attachments) and report:


Then XXX is 100% up-to-date.

Thanks again for your help.

Stefan
